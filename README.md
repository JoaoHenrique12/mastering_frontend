## About the license

As you can see, I'm using this repository just to sharper my skills in frontend 
development. So for me, if someone want use a code wich I made it's ok. But
is by your own risk use my code. By the way, there is a lot of images, taken 
from internet, with authorial rights. Finally, this repository have no comercial
intentions.
